# Rover Title Archive (Wuthering Waves)

A collaborative documentation project tracking all canonical names, titles, and aliases addressed to the Rover in *Wuthering Waves*.

## Project Objective

To compile a comprehensive list of titles backed by direct evidence. This repository distinguishes between verified in-game lore and unverified community claims.

## Repository Structure

The data is separated into two primary files located in the `data/` directory:

| File | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **[`canon_titles.md`](data/canon_titles.md)** | Titles confirmed via dialogue, item descriptions, or archive text. Every entry requires evidence. |
| **[`unverified.md`](data/unverified.md)** | Titles mentioned in community discussions but currently lacking screenshot evidence. |
