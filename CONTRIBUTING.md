# Contributing Guidelines

## General Rules

1.  **Evidence is Mandatory:** To move an entry to `canon_titles.md`, you must provide a verifiable source.
2.  **No Fanon:** Do not submit community nicknames (e.g., "Wife Gatherer") to the canon list.
3.  **Accuracy:** Ensure the title matches the in-game spelling and capitalization exactly.
